# AI Ethics and Human Flourishing

The question isn't "Can AI do this?" but "Should AI do this, and for whose benefit?"

## The Core Question

As someone working in education and watching AI tools proliferate, I keep returning to one framework: **Does this technology enhance human agency or diminish it?**

## What I'm Watching

### The Good
- AI as assistive technology for [[Published/0_Original/Neurodiversity as a Gift\|neurodivergent minds]]
- Tools that handle cognitive overhead (like this digital garden!)
- Democratization of knowledge creation

### The Concerning
- Surveillance capitalism dressed as "personalization"
- AI that replaces human judgment in contexts requiring wisdom
- The [[Everything is Figureoutable\|Everything is Figureoutable]] mentality applied where it doesn't belong

## Alaska Lens

Living in [[Published/0_Original/Sustainable Living in Alaska\|Alaska]] shapes how I think about AI ethics:

**Question**: What happens when your "smart home" loses internet for three days because of a storm?

**Answer**: You remember that resilience requires low-tech backup systems.

This isn't Luddism—it's systems thinking.

## Personal Stakes

My [[Published/0_Original/Neurodiversity as a Gift\|ADHD brain]] benefits enormously from AI tools that:
- Help convert unknown unknowns into known unknowns
- Provide structure for nonlinear thinking  
- Reduce executive function load

But I'm wary of tools that:
- Claim to "fix" neurodivergence rather than accommodate it
- Create dependency without building capability
- Extract data in exchange for accessibility

## Key Principles I'm Developing

1. **Technology should be transparent about its limits**
2. **AI should augment human wisdom, not replace it**
3. **Privacy isn't negotiable** (see: [[Digital Privacy in an AI World\|Digital Privacy in an AI World]])
4. **Accessibility is a right, not a premium feature**
