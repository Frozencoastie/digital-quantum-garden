# Sustainable Living in Alaska

Living sustainably in Alaska isn't about importing Southern California's solar-panel aesthetic. It's about understanding place, respecting limits, and building resilience in a landscape that doesn't forgive shortcuts.

## What Sustainability Means Here

In a state where:
- Winter darkness lasts 20 hours a day
- Supply chains are fragile and expensive
- Heating costs can break you
- The land itself is the greatest teacher

Sustainability becomes deeply practical, not theoretical.

## Core Principles

### Energy Consciousness
We don't have the luxury of wastefulness. Every kilowatt-hour in winter is precious. This has taught me more about [[Living Within Limits\|Living Within Limits]] than any environmental philosophy book.

### Community Resilience
When you're this remote, you depend on neighbors. [[The Coffee Shop as Third Place\|The Coffee Shop as Third Place]] explores how these community connections aren't optional—they're survival infrastructure.

### Respect for Indigenous Wisdom
Alaska Native communities have been practicing sustainability for 10,000+ years. Their wisdom about living with the land, not against it, informs everything. See my notes on [[Traditional Ecological Knowledge\|Traditional Ecological Knowledge]].

## Paradoxes I'm Wrestling With

How do I reconcile:
- Living in a petroleum economy while advocating for climate action?
- Driving a car in a state with minimal public transit?
- Eating imported food because local growing season is 90 days?

These tensions live in my note: [[Imperfect Environmentalism\|Imperfect Environmentalism]]

## Connected Ideas

This connects deeply with:
- [[Published/AI Ethics and Human Flourishing\|AI Ethics and Human Flourishing]] - Technology must serve place-based living
- [[Published/Neurodiversity as a Gift\|Neurodiversity as a Gift]] - Different cognitive styles see different solutions
- [[Published/Second Chances and Grace\|Second Chances and Grace]] - We're all learning; perfection isn't the point
