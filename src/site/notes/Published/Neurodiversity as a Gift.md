# Neurodiversity as a Gift

Three years ago, I received an ADHD diagnosis at age [redacted]. It explained everything and changed nothing and altered everything.

## The Journey

### Stage 1: Shame
"What's wrong with me?" (Ages 5-40)

### Stage 2: Diagnosis
"Oh. There's a name for this." (Age 43)

### Stage 3: Acceptance
"This is just how my brain works." (Age 43-45)

### Stage 4: Gift Recognition
"This gives me superpowers AND kryptonite." (Age 45-present)

### Stage 5: (In Progress) Comfort
Learning to stop masking, stop apologizing, stop trying to fit neurotypical patterns.

## What ADHD Gives Me

**Hyperfocus**: When something catches my interest, I can dive deeper than most people think to go. This digital garden? Built in a hyperfocus sprint.

**Pattern recognition**: My brain makes connections across disparate domains. See how [[Published/AI Ethics and Human Flourishing\|AI Ethics and Human Flourishing]] links to [[Published/Sustainable Living in Alaska\|Sustainable Living in Alaska]]? That's ADHD thinking.

**Crisis excellence**: I'm terrifyingly good in emergencies. Normal? That's where I struggle.

**Creative problem-solving**: The same "distractibility" that makes paperwork hell makes me great at lateral thinking.

## What ADHD Costs Me

**Executive dysfunction**: Starting tasks feels like pushing a boulder uphill.

**Rejection sensitivity**: Criticism hits like a physical blow. Working through this with [[Published/Second Chances and Grace\|grace frameworks]].

**Working memory issues**: I've developed entire systems to compensate (hence this external brain called a digital garden).

**Energy management**: I have a battery, not a steady supply.

## Why "Gift" Matters

Calling it a "gift" doesn't mean it's easy. It means:

1. **It's inherent to who I am**, not a bug to fix
2. **It brings unique strengths** alongside real challenges
3. **The world needs different cognitive styles** to solve complex problems
4. **Accommodations are justice**, not special treatment

## Practical Implications

This reframing changes everything:

- How I structure work (see: [[Obsidian as ADHD Accommodation\|Obsidian as ADHD Accommodation]])
- How I think about [[Published/AI Ethics and Human Flourishing\|AI tools]]
- Why [[Everything is Figureoutable\|Everything is Figureoutable]] resonates so deeply
- How I'm building [[Published/Sustainable Living in Alaska\|sustainable systems]]

## Resources That Helped

- Dr. Edward Hallowell's work on ADHD
- The concept of "twice exceptional" (2e)
- Understanding "high-functioning" as a trap (see: [[The High-Functioning Trap\|The High-Functioning Trap]])
