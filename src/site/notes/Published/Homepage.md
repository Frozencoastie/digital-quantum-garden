# Welcome to Alaska Morning Coffee ☕

*A digital garden exploring ideas at the intersection of sustainability, technology, and authentic living in the Last Frontier.*

## What You'll Find Here

This is my space for thinking out loud about things that matter. My notes are always evolving—some are polished essays, others are seeds just beginning to sprout.

### Core Themes

I'm particularly fascinated by how we can live more intentionally in a complex world:

- **[[Published/Sustainable Living in Alaska\|Sustainable Living in Alaska]]** - What it means to build a life aligned with the land
- **[[Published/AI Ethics and Human Flourishing\|AI Ethics and Human Flourishing]]** - Technology that serves people, not profits
- **[[Published/Neurodiversity as a Gift\|Neurodiversity as a Gift]]** - Reframing neurodiversity and different ways of thinking
- **[[Published/Second Chances and Grace\|Second Chances and Grace]]** - On transformation, forgiveness, and becoming

### Recent Thoughts

- [[The Coffee Shop as Third Place\|The Coffee Shop as Third Place]] - Why community spaces matter
- [[Mountain Metaphors for Personal Growth\|Mountain Metaphors for Personal Growth]]
- [[Everything is Figureoutable\|Everything is Figureoutable]] - On Marie Forleo's philosophy

## About This Garden

Hi, I'm Jeff, living in Anchorage with my spouse Brandi. After years of hiding parts of myself, I'm learning to show up authentically—neurodiversity, midlife awakening, and all.

This garden is my re-emergence into visibility. Welcome. 🌱
